# Regression--California-Housing-data

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting housing prices in California using multiple regression algorithms. The dataset used is the **California Housing dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`.

---

##  Objective

To evaluate multiple regression techniques in supervised learning and compare their performance on a real-world dataset.

---

##  Dataset

- **Source**: Built-in `fetch_california_housing()` function from `sklearn`
- **Features**: Median income, house age, average rooms, population, etc.
- **Target**: Median house value

---

## Models Used

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**
3. **Random Forest Regressor**
4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
5. **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**

---

##  Evaluation Metrics

Each model is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **R-squared Score (RÂ²)**
